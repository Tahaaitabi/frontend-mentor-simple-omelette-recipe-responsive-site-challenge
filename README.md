# FRONTEND-MENTOR SIMPLE OMELETTE RECIPE CHALLENGE

I used a little grid to get around an aligning issue I came across in the preparation container. Inside the images folder you will find a screenshot of the final design. 

Besides that, I didnt use anything out of the ordinay just normal mark up and CSS.

I went of the JPEG image that came with the original challenge so it's not 100% accurate. 
I aimed to use only rem units because its something I want to get more familar with instead of relying on absolute units, so I had to guess quite a fair bit.

(Without the Figma files at hand i'll be happy with a 70% match on this one)

Some parts were a bit difficut to around, in order to make them responsive; these being: 
- The HR (.separator).
- The lines separating the table rows. 

In the end I managed to make them work, sort of, but I can't help but get the feeling that there's a better way of doing it than the way I did. 
If you have some suggestions and tips for those issues in particular I would be grateful, since I couldn't find much online about it (probably not googling the right things, to be honest), as well as other things you guys can point out in the general design.

Thank you, FRONTEND MENTOR, this one definetly taught me some new tricks!
